Americans aren't ready for lab grown meat or driverless cars
The Pew Research Center and Smithsonian magazine called up 1,001 adults across the country to survey them on the future of technology, and the results are pretty interesting. For a country that's generally portrayed as technology-obsessed, this sample was surprisingly pessimistic about how technology might change our lives.
