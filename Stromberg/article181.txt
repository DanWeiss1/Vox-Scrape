Star Wars fans sent an X-wing into the stratosphere. The footage is amazing.
Star Wars fans are getting increasingly excited about The Force Awakens, due out in December.
So much so, in fact, that some of them are trying to send model X-wings into space in hopes of getting tickets to the premiere.
The BBC brings us the news that Phil St. Pier and Matt Kingsnorth, who run Project Helium Tears — a UK-based effort to use high-altitude weather balloons to photograph Earth from the lower edge of space — recently spent about £1,200 (about $1,820) to send a model X-wing up to roughly 22.3 miles. They attached a GoPro to capture the flight, and are using the footage to ask Force director J.J. Abrams for tickets.
Technically, this altitude isn't quite space (which is generally thought to begin at around 62 miles up), but the footage, paired with John Williams's signature score, is still pretty amazing. At the end of the video, you can see the balloon bursting, dropping the camera and X-wing back to Earth.
