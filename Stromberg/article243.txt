This year's Pi Day is even more special than you know
Today is the most magical day of the year: Pi Day.
It's also the most magical year of the century: Pi Year.
That is, today's date is 3/14/15 (at least in the US and a few other countries that write dates the same way), which matches up nicely with the first five digits of pi, the ratio of every circle's circumference to its diameter: 3.1415.
 






C/d = π. (kjoonlee)
What's more, at precisely 9:26:53 am, we'll have Pi Second: an even more magical time at which the date and time match up with the first 10 digits of pi, 3.141592653.
But it doesn't stop there. As University of Toronto statistician Jeffrey S. Rosenthal has pointed out, at an infinitesimally brief moment just after 9:26:53.58979 am but slightly before 9:26:53.5898 am, we'll have Pi Instant.
At this impossibly short moment, our particular civilization's way of marking the amount of time elapsed since an arbitrary date in history will match perfectly with every single digit of pi, an irrational number that literally never ends (when expressed in a base 10 numbering system, or any system that uses a natural number as its base).
Pi will ring throughout the land. It will extend to infinity. For the briefest of moments, pi will fill the gap in your soul.

Savor this moment. Appreciate it. Think of circles.
It won't happen again until 2115, when you'll probably be dead.
