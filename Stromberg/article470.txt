According to the AP, Russian President Vladmir Putin is blaming Ukraine for the MH17 crash.
In a statement, he said, "This tragedy would not have happened if there were peace on this land, if the military actions had not been renewed in southeast Ukraine. And, certainly, the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy."
