Stunning photos and video of the solar eclipse
On Friday, a solar eclipse was visible from Europe, along with parts of Northern Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.
Clouds obscured the view for some, but others took some pretty amazing photos and videos — especially from Svalbard and the Faroe Islands, where the eclipse was total, blocking out the sun entirely.
